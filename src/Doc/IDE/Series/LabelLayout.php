 * @property boolean $hideOverlap
 *    If hide the overlapped labels.
 *     The following example shows how to hide the overlapped labels in graph automatically when zooming.
 *
 * @property string $moveOverlap
 *    If move the overlapped labels to avoid overlapping.
 *     Currently supported configurations:
 *     
 *     shiftX Place the labels on horizontal direction sequencely, used when aligned horizontally.
 *     shiftY Place the labels on vertial direction sequencely, used when aligned vertically.
 *     
 *     The following example shows how to use moverOverlap: shiftY to place the labels aligned vertically.
 *
