 *     
 *     solid

 *     
 *     Since v5.0.0, it can also be a number or a number array to specify the dash array of the line. With 
 *     borderDashOffset
 *     , we can make the line style more flexible.
 *     For example：
 *     {
 *     
 *     borderType: [5, 10],
 *     
 *     borderDashOffset: 5
 *     }
 *

 *    
 *     Since v5.0.0
 *

 *     
 *     To set the line dash offset. With 
 *     borderType
 *     , we can make the line style more flexible.

 *
 * @property string $borderCap Default: 'butt'
 *    
 *     Since v5.0.0

 *     
 *     
 *     To specify how to draw the end points of the line.
 *     Possible values are:
 *     
 *     butt: The ends of lines are squared off at the endpoints.
 *     round: The ends of lines are rounded.
 *     square: The ends of lines are squared off by adding a box with an equal width and half the height of the lines thickness.
 *     
 *     Default value is butt. Refer to MDN lineCap for more details.
 *
 * @property string $borderJoin Default: 'bevel'
 *    
 *     Since v5.0.0
 *     
 *     
 *     
 *     To determine the shape used to join two line segments where they meet.
 *     Possible values are:
 *     
 *     bevel: Fills an additional triangular area between the common endpoint of connected segments, and the separate outside rectangular corners of each segment.
 *     round: Rounds off the corners of a shape by filling an additional sector of disc centered at the common endpoint of connected segments. The radius for these rounded corners is equal to the line width.
 *     miter: Connected segments are joined by extending their outside edges to connect at a single point, with the effect of filling an additional lozenge-shaped area. This setting is affected by the 
 *     borderMiterLimit
 *     property.
 *     
 *     Default value is bevel. Refer to MDN lineJoin for more details.
 *
 * @property int $borderMiterLimit Default: 10

 *     Refer to MDN miterLimit for more details.
 *
 * @property int $shadowBlur
 *    
 *     
 *     Size of shadow blur. This attribute should be used along with shadowColor,shadowOffsetX, shadowOffsetY to set shadow to component.
 *     For example:
 *     {
